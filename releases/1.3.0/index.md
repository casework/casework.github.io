## Release Notes

CASE 1.3.0 incorporates required refinements and updates, building on the stable 1.0.0 release.  Following [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), additive improvements will continue to be accepted, but backwards-incompatible changes will be scheduled only for the 2.0.0 release, which will come after at least 6 months to possibly 12 months.

This release adopts [UCO 1.3.0](https://unifiedcyberontology.org/releases/1.3.0/), incorporating bugfixes and test improvements from UCO 1.3.0.
