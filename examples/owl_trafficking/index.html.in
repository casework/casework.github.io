<h2>Owl CASE</h2>

<p>This investigative scenario emulates illegal activities involving trafficking of vulnerable victims, and download and exchange of related pictures. This document represents information from a Windows 10 computer and Android 6.0 smartphone using CASE.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 4em;"><em>Dataset generation</em>: Dataset was created by students at Marshall University.</p>

<p>The JSON-LD data on this page are available combined in the file <a href="owl_trafficking.json">owl_trafficking.json</a>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In a jurisdiction where owls are illegal to trade and buy, two individuals are suspected of illegally trading owls.  A computer and smartphone are collected as evidence and forensic examination is performed to determine whether the user is attempting to purchase owls illegally.</p>

<h3>Mandate</h3>

<p>The prosecutor in this case has requested digital forensic analysis of the digital evidence for the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The name and virtual identifier(s) of the primary user</li>
  <li>Possible accomplices the subject communicated with during the period(s) of interest</li>
  <li>Pictures of owls with associated context and classifications</li>
  <li>Evidence of purchasing an owl, or intent to purchase owls</li>
  <li>Pertinent location information, including any arranged meetings to exchange owls</li>
  <li>Visual reconstruction of the most pertinent elements and entities (people and objects)</li>
</ol>

<h3>EVIDENCE PROVENANCE AND INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>The initial step of the digital forensic analysis is to assess the provenance and integrity of the digital evidence and to examine device characteristics and identifiers. The overall CASE bundle provides context for the digital evidence.</p>

<h3>INVESTIGATIVE ACTIONS</h3>
<p>The provenance information provides an audit trail of forensic acquisition of data sources for traceability purposes. Which organization and/or individual generated the report using which tool, with general information about the investigation and evidential item entered by the user. The Android smartphone was retrieved and preserved as evidence on 6 February 2017 (physical extraction).</p>
