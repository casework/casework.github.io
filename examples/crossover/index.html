<h2>Crossover CASE</h2>

<p>This document uses CASE to represent digital evidence extracted from an Android device using Cellebrite, with Autopsy to fill in gaps. The physical image and scenario introduction can be downloaded from the following location: <a href="https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/GYze8UHvQ1N46Cx">https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/GYze8UHvQ1N46Cx</a>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>INTERPOL publicized an international request to put under surveillance Mr Ares Lupin on 27.11.2018. One of their informants communicated that this individual was implicated in the acquisition of a weapon of mass destruction. The suspect was spotted in Italy on 01.12.2018 and a surveillance was put in place by the Italian Carabinieri. He escaped their monitoring several times. On 11.12.2018, around 09:00 CET, the suspect was recognized by police at the University of Lausanne and he was put under arrest. The suspect fled and threw his smartphone in a rubbish bin. The suspect was not found again.</p>

<p>The mobile phone was retrieved and preserved as evidence on 11.12.2018 at 09:49 CET (physical extraction) using Cellebrite UFED.</p>

<h3>Mandate</h3>

<!--BOOKMARK ^-->
<p>The prosecutor in this case has requested digital forensic analysis of the digital evidence for the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The name and virtual identifier(s) of the primary user</li>
  <li>Possible accomplices the subject communicated with during the period(s) of interest</li>
  <li>Pictures of owls with associated context and classifications</li>
  <li>Evidence of purchasing an owl, or intent to purchase owls</li>
  <li>Pertinent location information, including any arranged meetings to exchange owls</li>
  <li>Visual reconstruction of the most pertinent elements and entities (people and objects)</li>
</ol>
<!--BOOKMARK v-->

<h3>EVIDENCE PROVENANCE AND INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>The initial step of the digital forensic analysis is to assess the provenance and integrity of the digital evidence and to examine device characteristics and identifiers. The overall CASE bundle provides context for the digital evidence.</p>
