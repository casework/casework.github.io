<h2>Crossover CASE - Linked</h2>

<p>The link between the two seemingly separate investigations is obtained by querying for email addresses.</p>

<p>The index of scenario portions is <a href="../crossover/">here</a>.</p>

{% highlight sparql %}
SELECT ?nInvestigationName ?lAddress
WHERE {

  ?nInvestigation
    a case-investigation:Investigation ;
    uco-core:name ?nInvestigationName ;
    .

  ?nEmailAddress
    a uco-observable:EmailAddress ;
    uco-core:hasFacet ?nEmailAddressFacet ;
    .

  ?nEmailAddressFacet
    uco-observable:addressValue ?lAddress ;
    .
}
{% endhighlight %}

The results of this query list the Investigation and associated email address, which reveal a link.
