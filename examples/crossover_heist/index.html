<h2>Crossover CASE - Heist</h2>

<p><em>Development note: The work-through for this scenario is being prepared.</em></p>

<p>The index of scenario portions is <a href="../crossover/">here</a>.</p>


<h3>Investigation 1 Background</h3>

<p>On 19 November 2018, at 14:18 (CET), three armed suspects entered a bank (Place de St-François 16, 1003 Lausanne). They blew up the safe and took the money inside. Several people were slightly injured. Witnesses say that the suspects fled northwest toward Place Chaudron in a car. The car was found 40 minutes later near the Lausanne-Blécherette airport. No physical traces were found in the vehicle, except for a USB key. A copy of the USB key was done on site by the investigators. No images were available from the surveillance cameras. Analysis of the bank’s system indicates that they were hacked a few minutes before the heist (19 November 2018 at 14:03 CET).</p>

<p>An IP address was found during the analysis. It was attributed to an apartment on the campus of the University of Lausanne. On 20 November 2018 at 10:00 CET, a search of the apartment led to the arrest of Mr. Joker and the seizure of a computer sitting in the living room. Mr. Joker was questioned and said he knew nothing about the heist. He also said that he lives with Mrs. Quinn. She was not present during the search and was not arrested. He said that she left the house early in the morning.</p>
