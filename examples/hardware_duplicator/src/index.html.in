<h2>Forensic Duplication of Storage Media</h2>

<p>This example represents the audit log output by a hardware duplicator (Logicube Falcon) used to create a forensic image of a hard drive. This data is from a fictitious multi-part investigation developed as part of the EVIDENCE2-eCODEX project.</p>

<p>The JSON-LD data on this page are available combined in the file [`hardware_duplicator.json`](hardware_duplicator.json).</p>


<h3>CASE INVESTIGATION CONTEXT</h3>

<p>The first part of representing information in CASE is to provide the context, including the header map (CASE/UCO IRIs), investigation details, those involved, and tool(s) used.</p>

{% endhighlight %}

<p>NOTE: Update Configuration settings to relationship</p>


<h3>EVIDENTIAL ITEM</h3>

<p>Representing the hard drive being acquired and its provenance record.</p>

{% highlight json %}
@HARDWARE_DUPLICATOR_EVIDENTIAL_ITEM.JSON@
{% endhighlight %}


<h3>PARTITION STRUCTURE</h3>

<p>Representing the partition structure of the evidential hard drive as reported by the Logicube Falcon.</p>
