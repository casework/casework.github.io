<h2 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-0.StatusoftheSpecification">0. Status of the Specification</h2><p> </p><p>CASE 1.0.0 is the first full release of the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE), which builds on and extends the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO). </p><p /><p>CASE 1.0.0 provides a stable version for adopters to use. Following <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">SemVer</a>, additive improvements will continue to be accepted, but backwards-incompatible changes will be scheduled only for the 2.0.0 release, which will come after at least 6 months to possibly 12 months.
<p>Details of support for migrating from earlier versions of CASE to CASE 1.0.0 can be found at: <a href="https://caseontology.org/releases/archive/">Releases Archive</a>.</p>
<p /><h2 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.Introduction">1. Introduction</h2><p>This ontology design document provides the specification for the CASE 1.0.0 ontology. The document covers: (1) the ontology engineering choices made in creating the CASE ontology, including the W3C standard ontology language (OWL 2), the knowledge representation approach including ontology design patterns, and the supported encodings; (2) the principal classes of entities included in the ontology to represent the cyber-investigation domain; and (3) the re-use of the <a href="https://unifiedcyberontology.org/resources/uco_design_document.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)</a>. Current documentation for UCO is available <a href="https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.1ThepurposeoftheCASEontology">1.1 The purpose of the CASE ontology</h3><p>The growing number of investigations involving digital evidence from various data sources is driving the demand for a standard way to represent, analyze, and exchange pertinent information. The purpose of CASE is to provide a common language to support automated normalization, interoperation, combination and validation of varied information sources to facilitate analysis and exploration of investigative questions (who, when, how long, where). This ontology-based standard promotes the consistency and reliability of investigative information, and enhances analysis capabilities, including searching, correlation, contextual analysis, pattern recognition, machine learning, and visualization. To this end, CASE provides a standardized, machine-understandable representation for information commonly analyzed and exchanged by people and systems during investigations involving digital evidence. CASE also ensures that analysis results can be protected and traced back to their source(s), keeping track of when, where and who used which tools to perform investigative actions on data sources. </p><p /><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.2DomainoftheCASEontology">1.2 Domain of the CASE ontology</h3><p>The principal domain of CASE is investigations involving digital evidence, including in criminal, cybersecurity, and intelligence contexts. The cyber-investigation domain places special requirements on the representation of investigation data, due to the nature of evidence and the need for traceability and flexibility in describing data with different degrees of certainty and/or at different stages of the investigation. These requirements are reflected in the namespace architecture and the design patterns used in the ontology. </p><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.3ScopeoftheCASEontology">1.3 Scope of the CASE ontology</h3><p>The scope of the CASE ontology covers investigations in any context, including in criminal, cybersecurity, and intelligence. Digital evidence includes data sources (mobile devices, storage media, memory) and well-known digital objects such as files and folders, messages (email, chat), documents (PDF, Word), multimedia (pictures, video, audio) and logs (browser history, events). CASE ensures that analysis results can be traced back to their source(s), keeping track of when, where and who used which tools to perform investigative actions on data sources. These details are generally referred to as provenance (e.g., chain of custody) and lineage (e.g., chain of evidence). CASE aligns with the <a href="https://github.com/casework/CASE-Implementation-PROV-O" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">PROV-O</a> ontology to support enhanced provenance tracking that is needed in more mature operating environments. Furthermore, data markings are baked into CASE to support protection of information.</p><p /><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.4RelationshiptotheUnifiedCyberOntology(UCO)">1.4 Relationship to the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)</h3><p>The CASE ontology is an extension of the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO), which is imported by CASE. CASE re-uses concepts from UCO to represent objects in the cyber domain that are of interest in an investigation. Section 2 provides background about CASE as an extension of UCO. Section 7 addresses details of how CASE uses UCO concepts.</p><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.5Howtoreadthisdocument">1.5 How to read this document</h3><p>This document contains two main foci: (1) explanation of the formal organization, including the knowledge representation standards and structures used in CASE (Sections 3 – 5); (2) description of the specific domain content of the CASE ontology (Sections 6).</p><p> </p><p>The format for CASE-compliant instance data is addressed in Section 8.</p><p> </p><p>The full concrete specification of CASE 1.0.0 is expressed in the W3C OWL 2 Turtle (.ttl) syntax.</p><p>The latest release may be accessed from the CASE Community Release web page: <a href="https://caseontology.org/releases/archive/" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://caseontology.org/releases/archive/</a> .</p><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.6SummaryofimportantchangessincetheCASEprototype(CASE0.1)">1.6 Summary of important changes since the CASE prototype (CASE 0.1)</h3><p>The initial CASE prototype was released in 2017 as a proof of concept. Early applications were developed to support use of the prototype.</p><p> </p><p>The CASE prototype took shortcuts in the interest of quickly developing a proof of concept. Among those was the copying of concepts from the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) into the CASE prototype namespace. Subsequently, following ontological best practices beginning with version 0.2.0, the CASE ontology has been published with concepts specific to the domain of investigation in the CASE namespace and importation of general concepts for the cyber domain from UCO. The CASE community provided a <a href="https://caseontology.org/releases/0.2.0/migration/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Migration Guide</a> for early adopters, as well as <a href="https://caseontology.org/releases/0.2.0/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">release notes</a> describing changes and updates.</p><p>Significantly, the class <code>Trace</code> was changed to <code>CyberItem</code>, the class <code>PropertyBundle</code> was changed to <code>Facet</code>, and the property <code>propertyBundle</code>, was changed to <code>uco-core:hasFacet</code>.  </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-1.7SummaryofimportantchangessinceCASE0.2.0">1.7 Summary of important changes since CASE 0.2.0</h3><p>CASE 0.2.0 (August 2020) implemented significant re-engineering based on ontology best practices. Concurrently, the CASE Community conducted a development process to ensure that CASE 1.0 would cover the domain concepts needed for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that could be used to encode cyber investigation data for exchange and analysis. CASE 0.2 incorporated some new concepts based on the early results of that process. The main part of that work is reflected in the expanded domain coverage of concepts in CASE 1.0.0.</p><p> </p>
<p><p>Specific enhancements and expansion of CASE versions leading to CASE 1.0.0 are described in the <a href="https://caseontology.org/releases/archive/">release notes</a> for each incremental version.</p>

<h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-2.1.CASErepresentscyber-investigations">2.1. CASE represents cyber-investigations</h3><p>The purpose of CASE is to define concepts for representing cyber-investigations. Essential concepts for the representation of investigations include <code>InvestigativeAction</code> (human and tools) and <code>ProvenanceRecord</code> for tracking when, where and who performed investigative actions on data sources, with what tool when applicable, and evidence-based hypothesis evaluation (e.g., probability of evidence given alternative hypotheses). </p><p /><ul><li><p>Casey, Barnum, Griffith, Snyder, van Beek, Nelson (2017) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Z-Slbvlz3aSkluRU1heUtkZEU/view" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Advancing coordinated cyber-investigations and tool interoperability using a community developed specification language</a></p></li><li><p>Casey, Barnum, Griffith, Snyder, van Beek, Nelson (2018) The Evolution of Expressing and Exchanging Cyber-Investigation Information in a Standardized Form</p></li><li><p>Casey, Biasiotti, Turchi (2017) <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~oard/desi7/papers/EC.pdf" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Using Standardization and Ontology to Enhance Data Protection and Intelligent Analysis</a></p></li><li><p>Chabot, Bertauxa, Nicolle, Kechadi (2015) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2015.07.005" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">An ontology-based approach for the reconstruction and analysis of digital incidents timelines</a></p></li><li><p>Casey, Back, Barnum (2015) <a href="https://github.com/dfrws/papers/blob/master/2015%20EU/2015_EU_paper-leveraging_cybox_to_standardize_representation_and_exchange_of_digital_forensic_information.pdf" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Leveraging CybOX™ to standardize representation and exchange of digital forensic information</a></p></li></ul><p /><p>The fundamental objects that CASE imports from UCO include <code>ObservableObject</code>, <code>Location</code>, <code>Tool</code> and <code>Identity</code>, as well as <code>Action</code>, <code>Annotation</code>, and <code>Relationship</code> objects. The full list of CASE concepts is provided in Section 8.</p><p> </p><p>For other concepts in the cyber domain, CASE imports UCO.</p><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-2.2.CASEimportsUCOforgeneralcyber-domainconcepts">2.2. CASE imports UCO for general cyber-domain concepts</h3><p>CASE imports the UCO ontology for use in representing objects and events that may be related to investigations (for example, computer files and electronic devices), but which are not inherently investigative concepts. By re-using cyber-domain concepts already defined by UCO, CASE takes advantage of work that experts have already done to represent the semantics of that domain in a machine-interpretable formalism. The UCO ontology includes both a model of the cyber-domain as understood by domain experts, and a terminology used by experts to describe the cyber-domain.</p><p> </p><p>With the release of CASE 1.0.0, the version of UCO that is imported will match, starting with UCO 1.0.0.</p><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-2.3.CASEalignswithontologydesignpatternsofUCO">2.3. CASE aligns with ontology design patterns of UCO</h3><p>The fundamental objects of study in cyber-investigations are the perceptible results of an event of interest. To represent these objects and their context, CASE makes use of ontology design patterns implemented in UCO, including those for <code>Facet</code>, <code>ObservableObject</code>, and <code>Relationship</code>.</p><p> </p><h4 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-2.3.1.FacetandObservableObject">2.3.1.    Facet and Observable Object</h4><p>An Observable Object can be enriched with one of more Facets, each with its own set of properties. Facets provide flexibility for representing the wide variety of data structures that can be encountered in cyber domains, and permit custom (non-standard) properties to be added if needed for internal or proprietary systems.</p>

  <figcaption>"<code>ObservableObject</code> with <code>Facets</code> that represent various properties."</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Further design details about <code>Facet</code> and <code>ObservableObject</code> are provided in the <a href="https://unifiedcyberontology.org/resources/uco_design_document.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">UCO Design Document</a>.</p><p> </p><p>In UCO, <code>ObservableObject</code> is an owl:Class whose instances represent individuals in the cyber domain. Certain aspects of those individuals are described using properties defined on the <code>ObservableObject</code> class; however, other descriptions may be applied to the instance by linking it to one or more Facet-instances. UCO defines Facet as an owl:Class representing a grouping of properties. Property assignment – that is, descriptions of individuals – using Facets differs from descriptions by properties defined directly on the <code>ObservableObject</code> class of which an individual is an instance.</p><p> </p><p>Properties defined on the class <code>ObservableObject</code> are those whose values are not expected to change when an individual is described, while the properties defined in a Facet class are used to assign values that may be updated in the future. Properties can include date-time stamps, the contents of an <code>ObservableObject</code>, the hash values (e.g., MD5 and SHA256) of the data, and other details. Properties are attributed to an <code>ObservableObject</code> using Facets (“hasFacet”), effectively using duck typing (enriching the object with the pattern relating Facet instances to instances of <code>ObservableObject</code>).</p>
<p> </p><p>A Facet is represented by an owl:Class. However, its instances are not domain individuals (e.g., files, accounts). Instead, they are anonymous individuals that organize properties to describe <em>other</em> individuals which are instances of Observable Object (or one of its subclasses).</p>
<p>The current range of UCO Facet subclasses with their associated definitions and properties are searchable in the <a href="https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/documentation/entities-tree-classes.html">Classes Tree</a>.
</p>
<p>An important use of subclasses is in the properties <code>deviceType</code> and <code>filesystemType</code>, which are fields that house free-form text descriptions of the type of device that an analyst has encountered.  The `@type` field should be preferred when a subclass of `observable:Device` or `observable:FileSystem` are defined and known to the analyst.  When those are not known, `deviceType` and `filesystemType` should be used to cover the representation gap.  Be aware that with the breadth of types available, full coverage is acknowledged as an impossible problem.  The CDO community welcomes feedback on knowledge gaps so taxonomic classes can be standardized, and interoperability improved.

<p> </p><h4 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-2.3.2.References">2.3.2.    References</h4><p>Within a Facet, certain Properties reference another object that is linked immutably, i.e., the link will never change. Such linked objects are represented using an identifier reference that specifies the @id of another object. For example, the manufacturer of a device is represented as a reference within the DeviceFacet:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/casework/CASE-Examples/blob/master/examples/illustrations/device/device.json" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/casework/CASE-Examples/blob/master/examples/illustrations/device/device.json</a> </p><p /><h4 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-2.3.3.Relationships">2.3.3.    Relationships</h4><p>In addition to using Properties as defined in OWL 2, UCO defines a class, <strong>Relationship</strong>, in order to represent information about relationships (such as their duration) that cannot be captured otherwise. For those familiar with UML, a UCO Relationship is similar in structure and purpose to a UML Association Class. </p>
<p> </p><p>As a general rule, a link between two objects should be represented as an independent Relationship object specifying the type of connection (a.k.a. external relationship). An example “contained-within” Relationship is the representation of a SIM card contained within a mobile device:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/casework/CASE-Examples/tree/master/examples/illustrations/mobile_device_and_sim_card" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/casework/CASE-Examples/tree/master/examples/illustrations/mobile_device_and_sim_card</a> </p><p>  </p><h4 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-2.3.4.DomainAssertions">2.3.4.    Domain Assertions</h4><p>In the OWL 2 language, domain assertions (i.e., using rdfs:domain) are not constraints on the use of properties. They are expressions of knowledge about the kind of thing to which a property is expected to apply, and those assertions can be used as the basis of an inference that an individual that is the subject of such a property is of a specific kind. [Include explanation of Open World Assumption and consequences of reasoning based on it.]</p><p> </p><p>Domain assertions for properties are included in the CASE ontology to capture knowledge about the type(s) of entity to which a property normally applies. However, CASE implements a design pattern in which those domain assertions are defined in a separate namespace (and ontology document) that may optionally not be loaded with the main ontology. This is to prevent unwanted inferences (based on domain assertions) about the types of individual entities, in applications where an  imposition of domain types on individual entities whose specific type is either unknown or may conflict with the expected type, may result in unwanted consequences.</p>

<p>The CASE Community has formalized its working relationship with the UCO Community, including written guidance on common software development practices.</p><p /><h2 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-3.DomainandScopeofCASE">3.   Domain and Scope of CASE</h2><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-3.1.Cyber-investigation">3.1. Cyber-investigation</h3><p>Cyber-investigation is the principal domain of the CASE ontology, and is defined most broadly to cover any context, including in criminal, cybersecurity, and intelligence. In cybersecurity contexts, the detection of a potential incident by a Security Operations Center (SOC) is the starting point of an investigation that can lead to Digital Forensics &amp; Incident Response (DFIR),  and ultimately legal action (e.g., regulatory compliance, criminal prosecution). In criminal contexts, the reporting of an offense initiates an investigation, followed by preservation and analysis of evidence, with the aim of apprehending and prosecuting perpetrators. In intelligence contexts, such as counter-terrorism operations, an investigation can combine information from various sources to support analysis and decision-making.</p><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-3.2.Provenance">3.2. Provenance</h3><p>In any investigation, it is important to maintain links between data sources, their treatment, and analysis results. CASE includes concepts for keeping track of when, where and who used which tools to perform investigative actions on data sources. These details are generally referred to as provenance (e.g., chain of custody) and lineage (e.g., chain of evidence). CASE tracks provenance and lineage with the combination of <strong>ProvenanceRecords</strong> and <strong>InvestigativeActions</strong> on data as shown here.</p><p />

<p /><h2 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-4.CASEisanOWLOntology">4.   CASE is an OWL Ontology</h2><p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-4.1.Introduction">4.1. Introduction</h3><p>The CASE ontology is a representation of the cyber-investigation domain created using the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (informally, “OWL 2”). OWL 2 is a W3C Recommendation (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/</a> ). The primary rationale for using OWL 2 is compatibility with other OWL 2 ontologies, enabling reuse of existing representations such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Semantic Sensor Network</a> (SSN) ontology and the <a href="http://qudt.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Quantity, Unit, Dimension and Type</a> (QUDT) ontology. The widespread use of OWL 2 supporting Semantic Web provides a stable foundation for development and interoperability. </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-4.2.ProfileofOWL">4.2. Profile of OWL</h3><p>To ensure compatibility with other OWL ontologies, CASE uses OWL DL rather than more restrictive profiles or OWL Full.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The original OWL profiles OWL Lite and OWL 1 DL are considered valid profiles of OWL 2 (see Section 1 at that URL). CASE probably will not be able to support more restrictive OWL Profiles.</p><p>Throughout the development of CASE and UCO, consideration has been given to the constraints of OWL profiles. See definitions of the OWL 2 profiles: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/</a>  . </p><p>Currently, it is necessary to check whether CASE and UCO violate a constraint of OWL 2 DL: (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-syntax/#Entity_Declarations_and_Typing" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-syntax/#Entity_Declarations_and_Typing</a> ). <em>Note the typing constraint in <strong>5.8.1 Typing Constraints of OWL 2 DL</strong>: “No IRI </em>I<em> is declared in </em>Ax<em> </em>[a set of axioms]<em> to be both a class and a datatype.”</em>]</p><h2 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-5.CASEOntologyArchitectureandNamespaces">5.   CASE Ontology Architecture and Namespaces</h2><p>The CASE ontology extends UCO with the Investigation namespaces and associated domain specific vocabulary.</p><ul><li><p>The namespace for the CASE ontology is <code>https://ontology.caseontology.org/case/</code>.

</div></div><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-6.2.InvestigativeActionandRole">6.2. InvestigativeAction and Role</h3><p>CASE uses <code>InvestigativeActions</code> to represent actions taken as part of an investigation, including initial evidence collection, subsequent tool processing, analysis activities, and reporting results. As a subclass of Action in UCO, an InvestigativeAction references the <code>location</code>, <code>performer</code>, <code>instrument</code>, and <code>environment</code> as well as the input <code>object</code> and output <code>result</code>.</p><p>Notably, the initial <code>InvestigativeAction</code> of seizing/receiving data sources has a null input and a <code>performer</code>  property that references a <code>Role</code>. Assigning a <code>Role</code> within a specific context allows the same person to have multiple roles in different contexts. For example, in the Oresteia example, Clytemnestra has the Role of Offender in Crime E and the Role of Victim in Crime F.

<p>Relationship are intentionally flexible to allow mutable/changeable links or associations to be defined between any object. For instance, a relationship between one object and another (e.g., SIM card in a mobile device) can last for a limited time period, and then can change (e.g., moving the SIM card to another mobile device). The  “Contained_Within” relationship is commonly used in CASE.

</div></div><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-6.6.Vocabularies">6.6. Vocabularies</h3>
To maintain consistency, CASE uses the UCO vocabulary pattern to represent certain proporties with a set of known values. For instance, representation of a <a href="https://github.com/casework/CASE-Examples/tree/master/examples/illustrations/reconstructed_file">Reconstructed File</a> uses the <code>HashNameVocab</code> UCO vocabulary to represent the hash algorithm (SHA256) used on the file content), and the <code>RecoveredObjectStatusVocab</code> UCO vocabulary to represent the recovered status of object attributes. 

<p>The vocabularies used in CASE and UCO are semi-open, so that other non-standardized values can be used if the defined vocabulary does not contain a suitable selection. To maintain consistency, it is recommended to add new terms to the vocabulary whenever feasible. 

<p> </p><h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-6.7.SeparateNamespaceforDomainAssertions">6.7. Separate Namespace for Domain Assertions</h3>
<p>CASE follows the UCO pattern of using separate name spaces for domain assertions, and uses the same conventions for naming classes and properties. Within CASE, the Investigation namespace contains concepts and terms specific to cyber-investigations.</p>

<h3 id="CASEOntologyDesignDocument-6.8.Cyber-investigationpatterns">6.8. Cyber-investigation patterns</h3>
