<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The objective that we want to achieve is to establish an approach to advance CASE, both by consolidating its 1.0 release by August 2022 at the latest and by releasing often small added value, now and in the future. The ratio for that is that a standard only becomes a standard when it is being used. In order to stimulate the use of CASE, it must (i) show a stable 1.0 version of the standard that is being governed, with (ii) an active community that (iii) drives its evolution.
