### Article I: Name 

The name of the organization shall be the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard 

Expression (CASE) Open Source Community. The short name “CASE Community” shall be 

used synonymously. 

In the remainder of this document, “Community” refers to the CASE Community. 

### Article II: Purpose 

The Community is organized with the purpose of developing and promoting the adoption of 

the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) as a Community-developed 

specification language. The primary motivation for CASE is to lessen the analytic burden of 

government and non-government cyber investigators and influence interoperability that will 

advance the efficient and accurate exchange of cyber-investigation information between 

tools and organizations. . CASE is intended to serve the needs of a broad range of 

cyber-investigation domains, including digital forensic science, incident response, 

counter-terrorism, criminal justice, forensic intelligence, and situational awareness. CASE 

aligns with and extends the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO). 

### Article III: Individual Members 

#### 3.1 Section A: Eligibility 

An individual may join the Community by submitting a completed membership request form 

to the CASE Community Governance Committee via the community’s website for approval.

described in Article V, Section G. 

#### 3.3 Section C: Member Classes 

There are four classes of members based on the type of organization with which the 

member is affiliated. Qualifications for Member Class affiliations are described below. 

Affiliation is determined by the member’s primary employer alignment, except in the case of 

independent contributors, who are assigned an affiliation as described below in item (b). 

Every member is affiliated with a member class. In the cases that a member has multiple 

employers of different types or where the member may not represent their primary

time of membership approval. Class affiliation shall be reviewed, and may change, when a 

member’s employment changes.

company that has a business license recognized by the local government of the geopolitical 

region in which they are headquartered. The company must sell a product (_i.e._, good or 

service) to the digital investigation community for the collection, analysis, and dissemination 

of trace cyber evidence. For-profit companies that open-source their digital investigations 

product will belong to the For-profit class. 

(b) Academia: Members affiliated with the Academia class must be employed by an 

institution of higher learning or must be independent (_i.e._, otherwise unaffiliated) 

contributors. The academic institution may be a for-profit or not-for-profit institution of higher 

learning. The academic institution must have at least one regional accreditation within the 

country in which it is headquartered. Professional staff of the academic institution must have 

published an article in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings on the general 

topic of digital investigations within the previous two years of Community member affiliation. 

Members who are prohibited to represent their employer(s) may be identified as 

independent. Independent digital investigation researchers and tool developers shall be 

affiliated with the Academia class following review and approval by the Presiding Director 

regarding the independent status of the member. 

(c) Government: Members affiliated with the Government class must be employed by a 

local, tribal, state or regional, national, or international governmental body (_e.g._, federal 

investigative agency, national standards agency, INTERPOL, government computer 

forensics laboratory, district attorney’s office). 

(d) Non-Profit: Members affiliated with the Non-Profit class must be employed by an 

organization that is formally established as a non-profit, not-for-profit, or non-governmental 

organization, or a similarly chartered entity that works in the public interest by engagement 

in a digital investigation mission, advocacy for digital investigation standards, or releasing 

digital investigation tools to the public.

the next highest number of votes for the remaining position will hold that position. The

The purpose of the Adoption Committee is to serve as a community-based forum to support 

the adoption of CASE as a technical standard for groups of people, systems, and software

cyber-investigation information. In order to do this, the Adoption Committee shall function 

as: 

(a) the working group for providing conditions and guidance for CASE compliance, 

(b) the coordinating body for the CASE Community to address all aspects of CASE adoption 

(e.g., mapping, importing, exporting, training aids and workshops, supporting framework 

tools and software integration), and 

(c) a technical advisory group to the CASE Technical Director for CASE adoption matters. 

Specific Adoption Committee activities include coordinating all aspects of supporting 

framework tools, including application programming interfaces (APIs), validation tools, and 

proofs-of-concepts (POCs), as well as collaborating with CASE adopters to generate 

change proposals to be addressed by the Adoption Committee or for submission to the 

CASE Ontology Committee. 

(d) In order to establish CASE as a global standard, the mission of the Adoption Committee 

is to promote and ease the adoption of the CASE Ontology by creating software and 

documentation, providing guidance, and running tutorial workshops to support CASE 

Adopters worldwide. 

(e) Adoption Committee members shall, individually and collectively, provide CASE 

Adopters with the pros/cons of different adoption approaches, allowing them to select the
