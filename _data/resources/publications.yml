- title: An abstract model for digital forensic analysis tools – A foundation for systematic error mitigation analysis
  desc: As automation within digital forensic tools becomes more advanced there is a need for a systematic approach to ensure the validity, reliability, and standardization of digital forensic results. This paper argues for intermediate output in a standardized format within digital forensic tools to allow a methodical approach to tool validation that targets errors at each stage of processing.
